        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Dexter Davenport, a 21-year-old software engineering student and family man. I graduated from American Leadership Academy in 2019 and started my higher education journey at Chandler-Gilbert Community College before transferring to Brigham Young University-Idaho. I'm on track to graduate in April 2023 with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering, which I'm very excited about.</p>


        <p>Aside from my academic pursuits, I'm also an Eagle Scout, having achieved this milestone at the young age of 13. I've always been passionate about learning new things and challenging myself, which is why I enjoy activities like mountain biking and playing musical instruments. However, my greatest source of joy comes from spending time with my wife and son. They inspire me to work hard and be the best version of myself.</p>

        
        <p>I'm eager to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world challenges and make a positive impact on the world. As you explore my portfolio, I hope you'll get a sense of my dedication, creativity, and passion for software engineering. Thank you for taking the time to get to know me.
